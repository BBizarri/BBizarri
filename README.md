Hello There, I'm Bruno Bizarri from Brazil
- I'm Interested in Data Analysis and Game Development as a hobby
- I'm currently learning Data Analysis, Power BI, SQL and Python through LinkedIn Learning. And also learning how to use game development engine Godot using C# and GD Script
- I'm looking to develop a better data analysis flow for my company and, if possible turn my career towards working specifically with it. Regarding Game Development I have a project with two friends from Team B group where we're trying to make our first game

- I'm still learning how to use Github, so if you are interested to see my projects but it's being hard to do so, please contact me
